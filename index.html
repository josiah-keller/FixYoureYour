        <h1>Fix You're Your</h1>
        <p><b>Fix You're Your</b> is a Twitter bot that "corrects" random peoples' use of the words your and you're.  It is meant purely as a joke, and deliberately gets things wrong sometimes.</p>
        <p>If you reply to the bot, it may reply to you a second time.  However, aside from its initial tweet to you and the potential second reply, it should <i>not</i> keep replying to you.  If it
        does, please reach out by DM to let us know and feel free to block or mute the account.</p>
